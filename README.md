# Fortnite EZ Edit
PoC of a revamped editing mechanic in Fortnite.

## How does it work?
A new edit key (called the Drag-n-Release edit key) can be set, holding this key will start an edit and hold down the left mouse button.
On release, the edit is confirmed.
This allows for quick editing using a single button.

A reset edit key can also be set.

## Why did you create this?
This is a Proof of Concept for an editing mechanic that, in my opinion, should be present in the Fortnite (Battle Royale) client.
The way editing works in the game at the moment comes from the Save the World edition of the game.
Given that fast editing has become a major advantage in competitive Fortnite BR, an approach that is not stronlgy dependent on the client's connection to the server (ping) is preferred.

Using the editing mechanic in the game, tile selection is often skipped because the user clicked to fast after starting an edit (AKA edit delay).
If a Drag-n-Release method would be implemented in the Fortnite client, this need not be the case.
